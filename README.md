# UniEvents-Hub-backend
This project is built in a python virtual environment so you need to create an virtual environment and activate it.
First CD into the root directory then run the following commands in the terminal.

python3 -m venv myvenv

If you are on windows you have open a terminal in command prompt not powershell and run the command
myenv\Scripts\activate

If you are on Mac then run the following command
source myenv/bin/activate

Once the virtual environment is activated, for the first time only you need to install all the dependecies by the following commands. Make sure you have that txt file in your current directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

You don't need to install the dependecies after the first time but you must need to activate the virtual environment in order to run the project.
