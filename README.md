First CD into the root directory then run the following commands in the terminal.

python3 -m venv myvenv

If you are on windows you have open a terminal in command prompt not powershell and run the command

myvenv\Scripts\activate

If you are on Mac then run the following command

Once the virtual environment is activated, for the first time only you need to install all the dependencies by the following commands. Make sure you have that txt file in your current directory

pip install -r requirements.txt
